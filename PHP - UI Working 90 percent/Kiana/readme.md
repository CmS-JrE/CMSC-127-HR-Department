Personnel is fully functional. Will add additional features on top of already existing core features. No more problems here.

Attendace is still lacking the table version of actual attendance per staff as well as leave forms. Numerous error checks are yet to be placed.
I.e. special cases like if the staff id doesn't exist for the record trying to be inserted/deleted/edited. Date fields will be 
changed to either bootstrap date pickers or drop down menus before finalization.

The lacking features of Attendance is part of the unfinished 10%.

In summary, this is the remaning work to be done:

1. Attendance Record per staff, stylized as clickable tables that are accessible by the attendance checker.
2. Error checking features: Existence of staff id, start date/end date overlapping for records that are consecutive 
    (ex. start date/end date consistency between the Attendance Record of a particular staff for the year 2017,2018,...)
3. Date fields should be bootstrap datepickers or drop down menus.
4. Leave forms and the appropriate checks and counters.
5. Leave Application and Approval
