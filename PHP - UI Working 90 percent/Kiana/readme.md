Personnel is fully functional. Will add additional features on top of already existing core features. No more problems here.

Attendace is still lacking the table version of actual attendance per staff as well as leave forms. Numerous error checks are yet to be placed.
I.e. special cases like if the staff id doesn't exist for the record trying to be inserted/deleted/edited. Date fields will be 
changed to either bootstrap date pickers or drop down menus before finalization.

The lacking features of Attendance is part of the unfinished 10%.
